# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
This project is implemented for the HCS12 microcontroller platform using assembly language. It builds upon previous homework assignments in the CMPEN 472 course, particularly the memory access functionality from Homework 6.

## Development Environment
- CodeWarrior development software
- HCS12 assembly language
- Axiom Manufacturing's CSM-12C128 board (24MHz)
- Terminal emulator for SCI communication

## Hardware
1. HCS12 Microcontroller
   - Port B for I/O operations
   - SCI interface for serial communication
   - Memory-mapped I/O registers

2. Port Configurations
   - PORTB ($0001): Data register
   - DDRB ($0003): Data direction register
   - SCI registers:
     - SCIBDH ($00C8): Baud Rate Register High
     - SCIBDL ($00C9): Baud Rate Register Low
     - SCICR2 ($00CB): Control Register 2
     - SCISR1 ($00CC): Status Register 1
     - SCIDRL ($00CF): Data Register Low

## Software Components
1. Core Program Files:
   - main.asm: Main program implementation
   - Previous homework implementations for reference

2. Memory Organization:
   - Variables: $3000-$30FF
   - Program code: $3100-$xxxx
   - Safe memory range: $3000-$3800

3. Register Usage:
   - A: Command processing, calculations
   - B: Bit manipulation, counters
   - X,Y: Memory pointers and access
   - Z: Not used

## Dependencies
1. Previous Project Code:
   - cmpen472hw6_Mbatia-1.asm: Base memory access implementation
   - Other homework implementations for reference

2. System Dependencies:
   - HCS12 instruction set
   - SCI communication protocol
   - Terminal I/O capabilities

## Build Process
1. Assembly:
   - Use CodeWarrior for assembly and linking
   - Absolute assembly with entry point 'pstart'

2. Deployment:
   - Program loaded to specific memory locations
   - Variables initialized in data section
   - Program execution from $3100

## Debugging & Testing
1. Debug Features:
   - Serial output for status messages
   - Error reporting via terminal
   - Memory content verification

2. Testing Methods:
   - Command syntax validation
   - Memory access verification
   - Error handling checks
   - Boundary condition testing

## Technical Constraints
1. Memory Limitations:
   - Safe memory range: $3000-$3800
   - Variable space: 256 bytes ($30FF - $3000)
   - Maximum command length: 16 characters

2. Hardware Constraints:
   - HCS12 processor capabilities
   - Serial communication timing
   - Register availability

3. Performance Requirements:
   - Efficient memory access
   - Responsive command processing
   - Reliable error handling
