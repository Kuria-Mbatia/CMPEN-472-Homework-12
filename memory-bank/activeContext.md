# Active Context

## Current Implementation Status

The program has been expanded to include several new commands beyond the original Homework 6 implementation:

- `S$xxxx` - Show memory contents at address `xxxx`
- `W$xxxx yyyy` - Write data value `yyyy` to memory location `xxxx`
- `MD$xxxx,yyyy` - Display `yyyy` bytes of memory from address `xxxx`
- `LD$xxxx` - Load data to memory starting at address `xxxx`
- `GO$xxxx` - Execute program at address `xxxx`
- `QUIT` - Exit to typewriter mode

All planned commands have been implemented with appropriate error handling and validation. The focus has now shifted to testing and validation of these commands.

## Code Examination

The `main.asm` file now includes several new functions:

1. **Command Parser Extension**
   - Enhanced to recognize MD, LD, and GO commands
   - Validates command format and parameters
   - Branches to appropriate command handlers

2. **MD Command Implementation**
   - Parses starting address and count parameters
   - Validates address range and format
   - Displays memory in 16-byte aligned rows
   - Shows only requested bytes within each row

3. **LD Command Implementation**
   - Parses starting address for data loading
   - Prompts for hex data input (32 characters per line)
   - Validates and loads hex data to memory
   - Provides feedback on total bytes loaded

4. **GO Command Implementation**
   - Parses target address for program execution
   - Validates address
   - Executes program with return handling
   - Uses JSR to preserve return path

## Command Processing Flow

The enhanced command processing now follows this sequence:
1. Display prompt `>` and wait for user input
2. Capture input until CR (Enter) is pressed
3. Process command based on first character:
   - 'S' → Show memory contents at specified address
   - 'W' → Write data to specified address
   - 'M' → Check for 'MD' command to display memory block
   - 'L' → Check for 'LD' command to load data
   - 'G' → Check for 'GO' command to execute program
   - 'Q' → Check for "QUIT" then exit to typewriter mode
4. For each command:
   - Verify the format matches requirements
   - Parse necessary parameters (addresses, counts, etc.)
   - Perform requested operation
   - Display results or error messages
5. Return to prompt for next command

## Current Focus

The current implementation focus is on:
1. Testing each new command with various inputs
2. Verifying boundary conditions and error handling
3. Testing the complete "Choi" example from the homework instructions
4. Final documentation and submission preparation

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy involves:

1. **Command Parser Tests**
   - Test recognition of all commands
   - Test command validation
   - Verify error handling for invalid formats

2. **MD Command Tests**
   - Test with various address ranges
   - Verify 16-byte boundary alignment
   - Test edge cases (small counts, large counts)
   - Verify display format matches requirements

3. **LD Command Tests**
   - Test with small data blocks
   - Verify correct memory storage
   - Test error handling for invalid hex data
   - Test with the "Choi" example

4. **GO Command Tests**
   - Test with simple test routines
   - Verify proper execution and return
   - Test error handling for invalid addresses
   - Test with the "Choi" example

5. **Integration Tests**
   - Test all commands together
   - Test command interactions
   - Complete the "Choi" example workflow
   - Verify all error handling scenarios

## Implementation Challenges

The key implementation challenges addressed were:
1. Parsing comma-separated parameters for the MD command
2. Hex data parsing for the LD command
3. Safely executing user code with the GO command
4. Error handling for all new commands
5. Maintaining compatibility with existing functionality

All these challenges have been successfully addressed in the implementation.

## Next Steps
1. Complete comprehensive testing of all commands
2. Finalize documentation
3. Prepare for submission

## Active Decisions
1. Testing Strategy:
   - Test commands individually first
   - Then test interactions between commands
   - Complete full "Choi" example workflow
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. Documentation Approach:
   - Update all memory bank files with final status
   - Document testing results
   - Prepare for submission

*Note: This document will be updated as testing and final preparations progress.*
