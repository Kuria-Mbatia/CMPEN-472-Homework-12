# Active Context

## Current Focus
This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions for the CMPEN 472 Homework 12 project. The project builds upon the memory access functionality implemented in Homework 6.

## Current Status
- Initial project setup complete
- Memory bank structure created and populated with base implementation details
- Base functionality identified from Homework 6:
  - Command-line interface via SCI
  - Memory access and modification commands
  - Error handling and safety checks
- Created dedicated debugging aids documentation

## Recent Changes
- Created project memory bank structure
- Documented existing functionality from Homework 6
- Identified core components and patterns
- Established technical context and requirements
- Added debuggingAids.md for debugging reference

## Active Decisions
1. Implementation Strategy:
   - How to extend the Homework 6 memory access program
   - What additional features to implement
   - How to maintain backward compatibility
   - How to best utilize debugging aids

2. Code Organization:
   - Whether to modify existing code or create new modules
   - How to integrate with previous homework code
   - Best practices for assembly code organization
   - Integration of debugging strategies

## Next Steps
1. Review the instruction files in detail:
   - Homework12_Instructions.pdf - Understand new requirements
   - Homework6_Instructions.pdf - Review base implementation
   - HW6aid1etc (1).pdf - Document debugging features and usage
   - HW6aid2etc (1).pdf - Document additional debugging tools

2. Technical Analysis:
   - Examine Previous_Project_Code for reusable components
   - Review existing memory access implementation
   - Identify areas for improvement or extension
   - Map debugging aids to development phases

3. Implementation Planning:
   - Define new features or modifications
   - Plan testing and validation approach
   - Consider error handling improvements
   - Integrate debugging strategies

4. Development:
   - Set up development environment
   - Implement required changes
   - Test and validate functionality
   - Apply debugging aids as needed

## Blockers & Questions
1. Documentation Access:
   - Need to access PDF instruction content
   - Understanding the relationship between HW12 and HW6
   - Understanding how to effectively use debugging aids

2. Technical Clarifications:
   - Specific new requirements from HW12
   - Any changes to memory safety requirements
   - Additional command functionality needed
   - Best practices for using debugging aids

## Current Development Priorities
1. Understanding Requirements:
   - Review all instruction files
   - Identify new functionality needed
   - Understand grading criteria
   - Master debugging aid usage

2. Technical Setup:
   - Verify development environment
   - Ensure access to necessary tools
   - Set up testing framework
   - Prepare debugging environment

3. Implementation:
   - Plan code modifications
   - Implement new features
   - Maintain documentation
   - Apply debugging strategies

*Note: This document will be updated as we progress through the project and gain clarity from the instruction files and debugging aids.*
