# Progress

## Project Status
This document tracks the progress, completed tasks, pending work, and known issues for the CMPEN 472 Homework 12 project. The project builds upon the memory access functionality from Homework 6.

## Completed Tasks
1. Initial Setup:
   - Created project memory bank structure
   - Documented core files:
     - projectbrief.md - Project overview and requirements
     - productContext.md - Problem domain and requirements
     - systemPatterns.md - Architecture and patterns
     - techContext.md - Technical specifications
     - activeContext.md - Current focus and decisions
     - progress.md - Project tracking

2. Base Implementation Analysis:
   - Identified core functionality from Homework 6
   - Documented existing command structure:
     - S$xxxx - Show memory contents
     - W$xxxx yyyy - Write to memory
     - QUIT - Exit program
   - Mapped out memory and register usage

## In Progress
1. Project Understanding:
   - Analyzing instruction files
   - Understanding relationship with Homework 6
   - Identifying new requirements

2. Technical Setup:
   - Reviewing development environment needs
   - Examining existing codebase
   - Planning implementation approach

## Pending Tasks
1. Documentation:
   - Review instruction PDFs
   - Update memory bank with specific requirements
   - Document any new features or changes

2. Implementation:
   - Examine Previous_Project_Code
   - Identify necessary modifications
   - Plan new feature implementation
   - Begin coding in Project directory

3. Testing:
   - Develop testing strategy
   - Implement validation checks
   - Verify memory safety

## Known Issues
1. Documentation Access:
   - Need to access PDF instruction content
   - Understanding complete requirements

2. Technical Understanding:
   - Relationship between HW12 and HW6
   - Specific new features needed
   - Any changes to existing functionality
