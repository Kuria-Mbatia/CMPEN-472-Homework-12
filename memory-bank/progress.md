## Project Status
This document tracks the progress, completed tasks, pending work, and known issues for the CMPEN 472 Homework 12 project. The project builds upon the memory access functionality from Homework 6.

## Completed Tasks
1. Initial Setup:
   - Created project memory bank structure
   - Documented core files:
     - projectbrief.md - Project overview and requirements
     - productContext.md - Problem domain and requirements
     - systemPatterns.md - Architecture and patterns
     - techContext.md - Technical specifications
     - activeContext.md - Current focus and decisions
     - progress.md - Project tracking

2. Base Implementation Analysis:
   - Identified core functionality from Homework 6
   - Documented existing command structure:
     - S$xxxx - Show memory contents
     - W$xxxx yyyy - Write to memory
     - QUIT - Exit program
   - Mapped out memory and register usage

3. Homework 12 Requirements Analysis:
   - Reviewed instruction document
   - Identified new commands to implement:
     - MD - Display continuous memory locations
     - LD - Load block of data to memory
     - GO - Run program at specified location
   - Identified enhancements for existing commands:
     - S$xxxx should display in binary, hex, and decimal
     - W$xxxx should accept both hex and decimal inputs

4. Current Code Review:
   - Analyzed existing code structure and functionality
   - Found that current implementation already:
     - Displays memory in binary, hex, and decimal formats (S command)
     - Accepts both hex and decimal inputs (W command)
     - Has robust error handling for existing commands
     - Includes necessary utility functions for new commands
   - Identified data section needs to be moved from $3800 to $3000

5. Implementation Planning:
   - Created detailed iterative implementation plan
   - Defined clear testing milestones
   - Prioritized implementation tasks
   - Determined approach for testing each command

6. Command Parser Extension:
   - ✓ Updated processCmd to recognize new commands
   - ✓ Created new command handlers
   - ✓ Implemented command validation logic
   - ✓ Updated error messages for all commands

7. MD Command Implementation:
   - ✓ Implemented address range parsing
   - ✓ Implemented 16-byte boundary alignment  
   - ✓ Created displayMemoryBlock function
   - ✓ Implemented error handling and edge cases

8. LD Command Implementation:
   - ✓ Implemented address parsing
   - ✓ Created loadMemoryBlock function
   - ✓ Implemented hex data parsing
   - ✓ Added error handling and validation

9. GO Command Implementation:
