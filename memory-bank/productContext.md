# Product Context

## Purpose
This project extends the Simple Memory Access Program developed in Homework 6, providing a command-line interface for memory manipulation on the HCS12 microcontroller. It serves as a practical application of embedded systems programming concepts, focusing on memory access, serial communication, and command processing.

## Problem Domain
- Embedded systems programming for HCS12 microcontroller
- Memory access and manipulation through serial interface
- Command-line parsing and processing
- Serial communication using SCI port
- Memory safety and validation

## User Experience Goals
- Provide intuitive command-line interface for memory operations
- Ensure reliable memory access and modification
- Implement clear error handling and user feedback
- Support both hexadecimal and decimal number formats
- Maintain consistent command syntax and behavior

## Functional Requirements
1. Serial Communication:
   - Use SCI port for terminal I/O
   - Support standard serial communication protocols
   - Handle input buffering and command parsing

2. Memory Operations:
   - Show memory contents (S$xxxx command)
   - Write to memory locations (W$xxxx yyyy command)
   - Support program termination (QUIT command)

3. Data Handling:
   - Support 16-bit word operations
   - Handle both hexadecimal and decimal formats
   - Validate memory addresses and data values
   - Ensure safe memory access within defined ranges

## Technical Requirements
- HCS12 microcontroller platform
- Assembly language implementation
- Memory usage:
  - $3000-$30FF: Variables and data
  - $3100-$xxxx: Program code
- Register usage optimization:
  - A: Command processing, temporary calculations
  - B: Bit manipulation, counters
  - X,Y: Pointers and memory access

## Constraints
- Memory safety boundaries ($3000-$3800)
- Maximum command length (16 characters)
- Hardware limitations of HCS12 platform
- Assembly language constraints
- Serial communication timing requirements
