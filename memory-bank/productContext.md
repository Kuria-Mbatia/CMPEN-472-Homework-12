# Product Context

## Purpose
This project implements a serial port-based MONITOR program for the HCS12 microcontroller. It extends the Simple Memory Access Program developed in Homework 6, providing a comprehensive command-line interface for memory manipulation, display, data loading, and program execution on the HCS12 microcontroller. It serves as a practical application of embedded systems programming concepts in a real-world monitoring tool.

## Problem Domain
- Embedded systems programming for HCS12 microcontroller
- Memory access and manipulation through serial interface
- Command-line parsing and processing
- Serial communication using SCI port
- Memory safety and validation
- Block memory operations and display
- Program execution control

## User Experience Goals
- Provide intuitive command-line interface for memory operations
- Ensure reliable memory access and modification
- Implement clear error handling and user feedback
- Support both hexadecimal and decimal number formats
- Maintain consistent command syntax and behavior
- Display memory contents in multiple formats (binary, hex, decimal)
- Support continuous memory display and data loading
- Enable program execution from specified locations

## Functional Requirements
1. Serial Communication:
   - Use SCI port for terminal I/O
   - Support standard serial communication protocols
   - Handle input buffering and command parsing
   - Support multi-line data input/output

2. Memory Operations:
   - Show memory contents in multiple formats (S command)
   - Write to memory locations with format flexibility (W command) 
   - Display continuous memory blocks (MD command)
   - Load data blocks to memory (LD command)
   - Support program execution (GO command)
   - Support program termination (QUIT command)

3. Data Handling:
   - Support 16-bit word operations
   - Handle both hexadecimal and decimal formats
   - Validate memory addresses and data values
   - Ensure safe memory access within defined ranges
   - Process block memory operations efficiently
   - Align memory displays to 16-byte boundaries

4. Command Set:
   - S$xxxx: Show memory content in word format (binary, hex, decimal)
   - W$xxxx yyyy: Write word to memory (accepts decimal or hex)
   - MD$xxxx $yyyy: Display continuous memory locations (16-byte rows)
   - LD$xxxx $yyyy: Load block of data to continuous memory
   - GO$xxxx: Run program at specified memory location
   - QUIT: Exit to typewriter program

5. Error Handling:
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid commands
   - Show command usage examples for errors
   - Ensure program doesn't crash on invalid input

## Technical Requirements
- HCS12 microcontroller platform
- Assembly language implementation
- Memory usage:
  - $3000-$30FF: Variables and data
  - $3100-$xxxx: Program code
- Register usage optimization:
  - A: Command processing, temporary calculations
  - B: Bit manipulation, counters
  - X,Y: Pointers and memory access

## Constraints
- Memory safety boundaries (entire addressable range)
- Maximum command length (80 characters)
- Hardware limitations of HCS12 platform
- Assembly language constraints
- Serial communication timing requirements
- Display format requirements:
  - Binary: %xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  - Hexadecimal: $xxxx
  - Decimal: xxxxx
  - Memory display: rows of 16 bytes
- Due date: April 25, 2025
