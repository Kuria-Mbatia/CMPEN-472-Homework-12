# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system is structured as a command-line memory access program for the HCS12 microcontroller. It uses a modular design with clear separation between data, program code, and utility functions. The architecture follows embedded systems best practices with careful memory management and register usage.

## System Components

### Core Components
1. Command Processor
   - Command parsing and validation
   - Command execution routing
   - Error handling

2. Memory Manager
   - Address validation
   - Memory access operations
   - Safety boundary checks

3. Serial Communication Interface
   - SCI port configuration
   - Character I/O handling
   - Terminal communication

4. Data Conversion Utilities
   - Hex/decimal number parsing
   - ASCII conversion routines
   - Data formatting for display

### Design Patterns
1. Command Pattern
   - Structured command processing
   - Command validation and routing
   - Extensible command set

2. State Machine
   - Command parsing states
   - Input processing states
   - Error handling states

3. Memory Safety Pattern
   - Address range validation
   - Safe memory access checks
   - Error prevention mechanisms

4. Input/Output Pattern
   - Buffered input handling
   - Formatted output generation
   - Terminal communication protocol

## Component Relationships
1. Command Flow:
   ```
   User Input -> Serial Interface -> Command Parser -> 
   Command Validator -> Memory Operations -> Output Formatter -> 
   Serial Interface -> User Display
   ```

2. Memory Operations Flow:
   ```
   Address Validation -> Safety Checks -> 
   Memory Access -> Data Conversion -> Output
   ```

3. Error Handling Flow:
   ```
   Error Detection -> Error Classification -> 
   Error Message Selection -> User Notification
   ```

## Code Organization
1. Memory Layout:
   - $3000-$30FF: Variables and data section
   - $3100-$xxxx: Program code section
   - Defined safety boundaries

2. Register Usage:
   - A: Command processing, calculations
   - B: Bit manipulation, counters
   - X,Y: Memory pointers and access
   - Z: Reserved (unused)

3. Module Structure:
   - Parameter declarations
   - Data section
   - Main program section
   - Utility subroutines

## Technical Decisions
1. Memory Safety:
   - Defined safe memory range ($3000-$3800)
   - Address validation before access
   - Error checking on all operations

2. Command Processing:
   - Maximum command length of 16 characters
   - Support for hex and decimal formats
   - Structured command parsing

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Optimized register usage
   - Efficient memory access patterns
   - Minimal processing overhead
