# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system is structured as a command-line memory access program for the HCS12 microcontroller. It uses a modular design with clear separation between data, program code, and utility functions. The architecture follows embedded systems best practices with careful memory management and register usage.

## Component Relationships
1. Command Flow:
   ```
   User Input -> Serial Interface -> Command Parser -> 
   Command Validator -> Memory Operations/Program Execution -> 
   Output Formatter -> Serial Interface -> User Display
   ```

2. Memory Operations Flow:
   ```
   Address Validation -> Safety Checks -> 
   Memory Access -> Data Conversion -> Output
   ```

3. Error Handling Flow:
   ```
   Error Detection -> Error Classification -> 
   Error Message Selection -> User Notification
   ```

4. Block Memory Operations Flow:
   ```
   Address Range Validation -> Block Size Calculation ->
   Block Alignment -> Sequential Memory Access ->
   Formatted Output Generation
   ```

5. Program Execution Flow:
   ```
   Address Validation -> Safety Checks ->
   Context Saving -> Address Jump
   ```

## Command Implementation Patterns

1. S Command (Show memory):
   ```
   Parse Address -> Validate Address -> Read Memory Word ->
   Format in Binary -> Format in Hex -> Format in Decimal ->
   Display All Formats
   ```

2. W Command (Write memory):
   ```
   Parse Address -> Validate Address -> Parse Data Value ->
   Determine Format (Hex/Decimal) -> Convert to Binary ->
   Write to Memory -> Verify -> Display Result
   ```

3. MD Command (Memory Display):
   ```
   Parse Address Range -> Validate Range -> Align to 16-byte Boundary ->
   Calculate Display Rows -> For Each Row: Format Address and 16 Bytes ->
   Display Row -> Continue Until End of Range
   ```

4. LD Command (Load Data):
   ```
   Parse Address and Size -> Validate Range -> Align to 16-byte Boundary ->
   Prompt for Data Input -> Parse Hex Data String -> Validate ->
   Write to Memory -> Continue Until Complete
   ```

5. GO Command (Execute Program):
   ```
   Parse Address -> Validate Address -> Save Context ->
   Jump to Address -> (Program Execution) -> Return to Monitor
   ```

## Code Organization
1. Memory Layout:
   - $3000-$30FF: Variables and data section
   - $3100-$xxxx: Program code section
   - Defined safety boundaries
   - Command-specific buffer areas

2. Register Usage:
   - A: Command processing, calculations
   - B: Bit manipulation, counters
   - X,Y: Memory pointers and access
   - Z: Reserved (unused)

3. Module Structure:
   - Parameter declarations
   - Data section
   - Main program section
   - Command processing routines
   - Memory operation utilities
   - Format conversion routines
   - Output formatting utilities

## Technical Decisions
1. Memory Safety:
   - Defined safe memory range ($3000-$3800)
   - Address validation before access
   - Error checking on all operations
   - Execution safety validation

2. Command Processing:
   - Maximum command length of 80 characters
   - Support for hex and decimal formats
   - Structured command parsing
   - Comprehensive error checking

3. Display Formatting:
   - Binary format: %xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   - Hex format: $xxxx
   - Decimal format: xxxxx
   - 16-byte row format for memory display

4. Performance Considerations:
   - Optimized register usage
   - Efficient memory access patterns
   - Minimal processing overhead
   - Buffer reuse where possible

## Memory Display Format
For MD command, memory is displayed in the format:
```
  xxxx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
```
Where:
- First column is the starting address of the row
- Following columns are the byte values in hex
- Each row displays 16 bytes
- Display starts and ends on 16-byte boundaries
